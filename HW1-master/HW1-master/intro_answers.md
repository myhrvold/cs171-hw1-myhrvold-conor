1.If we were interested in understanding summary statistics at a glance (minimum, maximum, etc.), how could you improve the display of the table?

The states are already ranked by descending order. We could have an option where you:
- hit a checkbox to resort in ascending order, thereby allowing you to see the max at the top.
- display the percentages as the main rank, and then afterward the states which have those percentages (more compact)

Adding more than just the table:
- in both cases, display numbers visually by the widths of svg rectanges that we create.
- you could also make a binned horizontal histogram (in ascending order, from left to right on x axis)

2.Find three varied examples on the web that present tabular data in a different layout or in more visually compelling, complete, interactive or interesting ways.
